# Japanese Study API

This is an API that can be used to store and retrieve Japanese kanji, vocabulary words, and particles. This API targets intermediate to advanced Japanese learners who struggle to find convenient ways to study Japanese because of the many facets of Japanese words (such as kunyomi, onyomi, and compounds) that traditional multi-language study programs do not account for.

This API was built using Laravel 5.
